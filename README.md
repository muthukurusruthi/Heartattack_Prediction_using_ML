❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using PyCaret
📌 Overview
This project uses PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library, to predict the risk of a heart attack based on patient health data. The model is trained on medical features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits to provide an accurate risk assessment.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains key health indicators such as:

Age 🏥
Cholesterol Levels 🩸
Blood Pressure ❤️
Heart Rate 💓
Diabetes History 🔬
Smoking & Alcohol Consumption 🚬🍷
Obesity & Exercise Habits 🏃
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
PyCaret (for AutoML) ⚡
Pandas & NumPy (data processing) 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization) 📈
Scikit-learn (model evaluation) 🤖
